Ducks are an immense group of aquatic birds, known as waterfowl. They are in
the Anatidae family, and share this family with swans and geese as well. As a
group, the vast majority of these birds are smaller than swans and geese. They
usually live in fresh waters like lakes and ponds, but some species live in
brackish or salt water.
