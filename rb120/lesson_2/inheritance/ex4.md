QUESTION:

What is the method lookup path and how is it important?

ANSWER:

The method lookup path is the order in which classes and
modules are inspected when you call a method. This is
important to know in that it can help explain the behavior
of a particular method that an object is calling and could
assist in painting a bigger picture in knowing where everything
is coming from/how everything is organized.
